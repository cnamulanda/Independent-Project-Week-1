     <h3><strong>About Me.......</strong></h3>
    <p>My name is Christine Namulanda and have a masters degree in Economic Development from the Busch School of Business (CUA). 
      I was working with the IFC World bank (9 years) in Washington DC before relocating back to Kenya a few months ago. 
      In between looking for a job or starting my own company<em>(whoop whoop)</em> i decided to enroll in Moringa to learn coding. I have supported IT systems for most of my career but i have never known what goes on in the backend. By coming to Moringa i hope to understand what really goes on the backend and also equip myself for the future.</p>
    <P>My hobbies are : </P>
    <ul>
        <li>Travelling</li>
        <li>Listening to music</li>
        <li>The Arts</li>
        <li>Socializing</li>
    </ul>

  <p><strong>The End....</strong></p>
